    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="align-left">I am an avid coder who has worked mainly with C++ and Python. I am currently learning web development. The frameworks I am learning are python with flask and ruby on rails. I plan to work on web applications, command line utilities, and operating systems. I want to learn data science and machine learning as well. I have been tinkering with many python libraries and reading a few books on the subject.</p>
    <p class="align-left">I am creating my own website using Flask and Python, hosted on Github, and running on Heroku. I will be adding blog posts and tutorials on various dev topics.</p>
